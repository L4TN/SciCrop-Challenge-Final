# SciCrop Geolocalizations-App Challenge
This repository has the objective of elaborating and solving the challenge proposed by the company SciCrop by creating an application that meets the requirements set out below:

| Functional Requiriments                | Non-Functional Requiriments                                   | 
| :----------------------:               | :----------------------------------------------------------:  | 
| User can register a new Location       | The system must run on web platform (Portability)             | 
| List     Locations                     | The system must use a Javascript library (Implementation )    |                                               
| View Locations in Map                  | the system must persist data. (Interoperability) |
